# Group Users

## User types

There are 2 types of users in Rechat. _Agent_ and _Client_.
An _Agent_ is a licensed Real Estate Broker who uses Rechat to utilize his workflow.

A client is someone looking for a Real Estate transaction.

There are features built in Rechat to enhance both types of clients use cases.

## Shadow Users

Rechat is an open platform. That means we do not want our agents to _enforce_ their clients to install Rechat.
That means a Rechat user (mostly clients) should be able to communicate using email or phones.

This means when an agent invites a client using her email address or phone number, we actually
create a user object in our database for the client. This way we can track her communication.

Therefore a _Shadow User_ is a user who has been invited to Rechat but has not completed her sign up yet.

::: note
It is important to remember that shadow users _can_ use some of the Rechat's features using Email/Phone.
