### Schedule a gmail message [POST /emails]
If either of `credential.deleted_at is not null` or `credentila.revoked is true` is met, then credential is disconnected.
So it should not be allowed to send or read an email if user's connected account is disconnected.

When a user wants to send an email through Gmail or Outlook, two conditions should be met.
* `credential.deleted_at is null` and `credentila.revoked is false`
* `credential.scope_summary` includes `mail.send`

Every Google and Microsoft connected account has a field with the name `scope_summary`.
This is all of our avaailable scopes: `["profile", "contacts.read", "mail.read", "mail.send", "mail.modify", "calendar"]`

When a user wants to update email IsRead flag, two conditions should be met.
* `credential.deleted_at is null` and `credentila.revoked is false`
* `credential.scope_summary` includes `mail.send and mail.modify`
