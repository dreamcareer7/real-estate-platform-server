#Group Deal

## Overview

A _Deal_ holds information about a Real Estate Deal/Transaction.

Each deal has the following attributes:

* An MLS listing (Optional). (If the listing is missing, the deal is called a _Hippocket_)
* Brand this deal belongs to (Optional)
* Context. A key-value object consisting context of the deal (dates, prices, names, etc)
* Proposed Values. A key-value object consisting of values that we have extracted from
  different sources and we propose them to be used instead of context.
* Roles. People and the role they have in this deal.

### Context

A deal may consist of many different data that are gathered from different sources.
MLS, DCAD, user-submitted-forms and the user interfaces are current data sources.

contexts are stored in `deal.deal_context` object.
For example, `street_name` of a deal can be fetched from `deal.deal_context.street_name`.

Contexts are defined by each brand. Please refer to brand documentation to see how you can
get a list of available contexts for each brand.
