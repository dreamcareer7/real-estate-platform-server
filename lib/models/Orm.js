/*
 * This model takes care of populating data objects.
 * To understand the way it works, you need to be familiar with several concepts.
 *
 * === Entities ===
 *
 * An `entity` represents a single data unit.
 *
 * Each entity must have:
 *  - An ID.  A string that we can use later to fetch it. (Usually but not necessarily a uuid)
 *  - A type. A string unique to this model.
 *
 * For example, a user entity can look like this:
 *  {
 *    id: '66e110e0-37e2-11e7-bb6e-e4a7a08e15d4',
 *    type: 'user',
 *    email: 'emil@rechat.com',
 *    ...
 *  }
 *
 * === Models ===
 *
 * Each Rechat Model is a global variable starting with a capital letter that represents an entity.
 * Models are practically a bunch of functions under a namespace that allow you to operate on entities.
 *
 * Each Rechat Model Must:
 *
 *  1. Implement a Model.getAll(ids, cb) function.
 *     This function will get an array of ID's and returns entities with those ID's.
 *
 *  2. Register itself by calling `Orm.register('entity_type', 'Model_Name')`
 *
 * So, to represent a `user` identity, we should have a User model.
 *
 * User = {
 *  getAll: (ids, cb) => {...}
 * }
 *
 * Orm.register('user', 'User')
 *
 * The `Orm.register` call will let the Orm tool know that all entities with
 * type: 'user' must be handled by the User model. Basically, User model will
 * be responsible for handling all entities with type:'user'.
 *
 * === Associations ===
 *
 * Main purpose of the Orm tool is to make it easy for entities to have relations and associations.
 *
 * Each model should describe its associations in a declarative way.
 * That means, it should be able to tell what associations it has.
 * Then, the ORM tool, can be more effective and intelligent in fetching associations.
 *
 * For example, a Room, can have an owner. The owner is a "user".
 * If the Room model declares this association, any time a room entity
 * is being sent to clients, will have the "owner" populated as well.
 *
 * You can declare associations for your models like this:
 *
 * MyModel.associations = {
 *  association_1: {association1_decleration},
 *  association_2: {association2_decleration},
 *  ...
 * }
 *
 * There are 2 kinds of associations: Singles or collections.
 * A single association basically resembled a One-To-One  relationship,
 * while a collection association resembled a One-To_Many relationship.
 * For example a room can has several users. Therefore, `room.users` should
 * be an array of User objects. (One to many)
 *
 * All associations can have one of these properties:
 *
 * `model` [String|Function]
 *         A string pointing to the Model that this association connects to. (Like 'User')
 *         For example, `room.owner` should be connected to `User` model as its supposed to return a User.
 *
 *         You can also provide a function that will take in a entity and return the
 *         model name that must be used based on entity. Like this:
 *         (model, cb) => cb(null, model.subject_class)
 *         In this case, the model will be connection to whatever model that is stored
 *         in subject_class property.
 *
 *         Use the function if the relation is not predefined and can differ based on each different entity.
 *
 * `enabled` [Boolean] Default: true
 *         Declares it this association should be populated by default or no
 *
 * The following properties are only applicable to One-To-One associations:
 *
 * `id`    [Function] (Optional)
 *         A function that determines the ID of the relation that must be fetched.
 *         If missing, Orm tool will assume the association name for this.
 *         For example, if you have a `room` entity that looks like this:
 *
 *         {
 *           id: 'a40394ae-37e5-11e7-bb6e-e4a7a08e15d4',
 *           type: 'room',
 *           owner: '66e110e0-37e2-11e7-bb6e-e4a7a08e15d4'
 *         }
 *
 *         You don't realy need the `id` function. Your association should look like:
 *
 *         Room.associations = {
 *           owner: {
 *             model: 'User'
 *           }
 *         }
 *
 *         But if the id of the is not stored on the object itself or depends
 *         on logic per-entity, you can provide a function:
 *
 *         Notification.associations = {
 *           subject: {
 *            model: (n, cb) => cb(null, n.subject_class),
 *            id: (n, cb) => cb(null, n.subject)
 *           }
 *         }
 *
 * `optional` [Boolean] Default: false
 *         Declares if this association is optional or not.
 *         If the association is not optional but is missing, Orm will throw an error
 *         while populating it as it shows an underlying issue
 *
 *
